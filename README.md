# Flexbox-Playground

Flexbox Playground was done with simple JS, CSS and HTML, it features the flexbox properties which are animated. 
Animation works thanks to a trick that saves the position before and after changing a property while changing itself is too quick to be seen and then position just changes with simple transition.
