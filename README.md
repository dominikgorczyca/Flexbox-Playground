# Flexbox-Playground

Flexbox Playground was done with simple JS, CSS and HTML, it let's you try out flexbox properties and animates the changes. 
Animation works thanks to a trick that saves the position before and after changing a property while changing itself is too quick to be seen and then position just changes with simple transition.
